# Get your To-Do tasks every morning on Microsoft Teams using Azure Logic Apps

I am super excited since [Microsoft Graph To Do APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/todo-concept-overview?view=graph-rest-beta&WT.mc_id=m365-0000-aycabas) are introduced at Microsoft Build 2020. We finally have APIs available in public preview on the beta endpoint of Graph. 

Just a brief introduction, [Microsoft To Do](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/microsoft-to-do-list-app?rtc=1&WT.mc_id=m365-0000-aycabas) and [Planner](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business/task-management-software?WT.mc_id=m365-0000-aycabas) are the essence of tasks in Microsoft 365. To-Do helps you create a list for anything, from work assignments to school projects to groceries. It is a great tool for your personal use. On the other hand, Planner is the best place to collaborate as a team and keep your team tasks. Tasks come from everywhere, you can keep track of deadlines by adding reminders, due dates, and notes. 

## Wouldn't it be nice to receive your list of assigned tasks every morning on Microsoft Teams? 

Today, we will build a flow using [Azure Logic Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/?WT.mc_id=m365-0000-aycabas) to automate Microsoft Teams Flow bot for sending To-Do tasks every morning at 9 AM. Here is the steps we will follow:
* Learn the queries and responses about Microsoft Graph To-Do APIs in [Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer?WT.mc_id=m365-0000-aycabas)
* Register your app in [Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app?WT.mc_id=m365-0000-aycabas)
* Build [Azure Logic Apps Custom Connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/custom-connector-overview?WT.mc_id=m365-0000-aycabas) to consume Graph To-Do API and get the tasks
* Create Logic Apps flow to automate sending tasks from Microsoft Teams Flow bot every morning

### Microsoft Graph To-Do APIs in Graph Explorer

To be able to review Microsoft Graph To-Do API queries and responses with your own data, go to [Microsoft Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer?WT.mc_id=m365-0000-aycabas) and login with your account from the top left corner by clicking **Sign in to Graph Explorer**.

Then, search for "to do" under **Sample queries** and select **Get my to do task list**. This will run the query `https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/todo/lists` and will get all the task lists as a response. Copy one of your preferred task list Id from the response.

![To-Do in Graph Explorer](./Images/GraphExplorer-01.png)

Let's try to get all the tasks under your preferred task list. Change the query with the following: `https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/todo/lists/{taskListId}/tasks`. Make sure the request is `GET` and hit `Run query`. You should be able to see all tasks under the selected list as a response.

Copy this query and save somewhere, we will use this later while creating a custom connector.

### Register your app in Azure Active Directory

Go to **Azure Active Directory** in [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/?WT.mc_id=m365-0000-aycabas). Select **App Registrations** and choose **New registation**.

![Azure Active Directory App Registration](./Images/AAD-App-Registration-01.png)

Enter `To-do-flow-app` in the Name field. In the Supported account types section, select **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts**. Leave **Redirect URI** blank and choose **Register** to continue.

![Azure Active Directory App Registration](./Images/AAD-App-Registration-02.png)

Go to **API permissions** from the left hand side menu and select **add a permission**. Choose **Microsoft Graph** and **Delegated Permissions**. Select `Task.ReadWrite` and click **Add permission** button.

![Azure Active Directory App Registration](./Images/AAD-App-Registration-03.png)

Go to **Certificates & secrets** from the left hand side menu and select **New client secret** under the **Client secrets**. Choose expiry time and **Add**.  

![Azure Active Directory App Registration](./Images/AAD-App-Registration-04.png)

Copy the `secret` you created and `Application Id` under the **Overview** page. Save them somewhere, we will use them while creating a custom connector.

### Build Azure Logic Apps Custom Connector to consume To-Do APIs in a flow

Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/?WT.mc_id=m365-0000-aycabas) and create [Logic Apps Custom Connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/custom-connector-overview?WT.mc_id=m365-0000-aycabas).

![Logic Apps Custom Connector](./Images/CustomConnector-01.png)

Click plus button, go to **Custom** and choose **To-Do Connector** as a next step and select **Get To-Do Tasks** as an action.

![Logic Apps Flow](./Images/LogicApps-05.png)

Sign in with the same account you practiced To-Do APIs in the Graph Explorer.

![Logic Apps Flow](./Images/LogicApps-06.png)

Run the flow and see if you successfully get to-do tasks by using your **Get To-Do Tasks**. Copy the outputs `body`, we will use it in the next step.

![Logic Apps Flow Results](./Images/LogicApps-Results-01.png)

Add **Parse JSON** as a next step. Place **Get To-Do Tasks** `body` under the **Context**. Select **generate schema**, paste the response body you are receiving from the **Get To-Do Tasks** and save.

![Logic Apps Flow](./Images/LogicApps-07.png)

Add **Initialize variable** as a next step. Fill the field as follows:
* **Name:** `Tasks`
* **Type:** `Array`
* **Value:** leave blank

Add **For each** as a next step and fill the fields as follows:
* **output from previous steps:** `value` from the **Parse JSON** step

Add **Compose** in **For each** and fill the fields as follows: 
* **inputs:** `title` from the **Parse JSON** step

Add **Append to array variable** in **For each**, and fill the fields as follows:
* **Name:** `Tasks` 
* **Value:** `Outputs` from the **Compose** step.

![Logic Apps Flow](./Images/LogicApps-08.png)

Run the flow and see if To-Do Json response is successfully parsed and all task titles are added in the `Tasks` array.

![Logic Apps Flow Results](./Images/LogicApps-Results-02.png)
![Logic Apps Flow Results](./Images/LogicApps-Results-03.png)

As a next step after **For each**, add **Post a choice of options as the Flow bot to a user** and fill the fields as follows:
* **Options:** `Tasks` from the **Variables** step
* **Headline:** `Good morning!`
* **Receipent:** The same account you consumed the custom connector
* **Message:** `Here is your tasks, have a great day! :)`
* **IsAlert:** `Yes`

![Logic Apps Flow](./Images/LogicApps-09.png)

Run the flow and see check [Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/?WT.mc_id=m365-0000-aycabas) for the related account if Flow bot is sending a message. Select one of the tasks to see the results in the Logic app flow. 

`Note: If you didn't add Flow in your Microsoft Teams yet, here is the steps to enable Flow in your Teams account: https://cda.ms/1BB`

![Logic Apps Flow Results](./Images/LogicApps-Results-04.png)

Finally, after user selected any of the tasks to see more details, we will post another card to share more details about the selected option.

Add **For each** after **Post a choice of options as the Flow bot to a user** and fill the fields as follows:
* **Output from previous steps:** `value` from **Parse JSON** step

Add **Condition** in **For each** and fill the fields as follows:
* **Condition:** `And`

    Add **Post message as a  Flow bot to a user** in true
      * **Headline:** `title` from **Parse JSON** step
      * **Receipent:** The same account you consumed the custom connector
      * **Message:** `importance`. `status`, `createdDateTime` from **ParseJSON** step
      * **IsAlert:** `Yes`
  
  * **If false:** leave blank
